# Developer's Timeout notes #

This is a public repo to register the [Developer's Timeout](https://medium.com/developers-timeout) Community Notes.

### Mission ###

The [Developer's Timeout](https://medium.com/developers-timeout) aims to be a space for:

- Sharing (Knowledge, Experiences, Ideas, ...)
- Discussions (Tech, Business, Processes, Ideas, ...)
- Interviews (Insights from Technical Leads, Experienced Engineers)
- Other related topics

As developers, we understand the software construction involves much more than just writing code. Adequate processes, team dynamics, collaboration, communication, career expectations, and even politics can play a very big part into how things get done and how people play their part. We hope to make this a space where healthy discussions can flourish.

### Governance ###

The [Developer's Timeout](https://medium.com/developers-timeout) is lead by its founders, which normally will have a vote for key decisions. But, as an open community, all interested members can and should contribute with ideas and be part of the decisions.

Founders:

- [MÃ¡rcio Azevedo](https://anoblequest.wordpress.com/)
- [Miguel Alho](http://www.miguelalho.pt/)
- [Carlos Silva](https://pt.linkedin.com/in/carlos-silva-21b5131)
